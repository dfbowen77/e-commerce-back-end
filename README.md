# e-commerce-back-end
This repo represents my submission for the module 13 challenge to create the back-end of an e-commerce web application.  

## Description
The following program is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 13 Challenge. It represents the backend of a generic e-commerce web application. The back-end code has been developed to allow users to view, update, create, and delete products, categories, and tags that are associated with the products sold on the generic e-commerce web site. Users can view the names and ids of the products, categories, and tags. Moreover, they can see how much a product costs and how many of those products are in stock. Each of the associations/relationships between products, categories, and tags are also coded into the database so that , for instance, when viewing a category the products associated with that category as well as all the product information is available.
